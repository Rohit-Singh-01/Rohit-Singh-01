## About Me

As a diligent and persistent Full Stack Developer, I specialize in UI technologies including MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. I have experience in Python, JavaScript, and Java, along with CI/CD tools like Git, GitLab, and Docker. My background includes working with AI and ML models, and I am quick to adapt to new technologies. I am familiar with Linux, networking, shell scripting, and OS-related tasks. I have volunteered as a student coordinator for AI/ML events and led projects at SWECHA Telangana. Additionally, I use tools such as Grafana and Prometheus for visualization and have experience with Python libraries like scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, and the Django framework.

I am currently contributing to open-source projects, exploring ways to innovate and give back to the developer community. In particular, I am excited about leveraging AI and web development for impactful real-world solutions.

## Projects

### Artificial Intelligence in Structural Health Monitoring
**07/2024 - Present | Swecha, Telangana**

Integrating AI into Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) provides real-time damage detection and early identification, reducing downtime and repair costs. This approach enhances infrastructure safety, longevity, and maintenance efficiency.

**Key Contributions:**

- üèóÔ∏è Enhanced structural safety and reliability: Early detection of damage, improved risk assessment, and optimized maintenance planning.
- üí∏ Cost reduction: Reduced maintenance costs, extended asset lifespan, and optimized resource allocation.
- üìä Improved decision making: Data-driven insights, risk-based maintenance, and performance optimization.
- üíº Increased asset value: Demonstrated structural integrity for potential buyers or investors.
- üöß Enhanced public safety: Protection of the public from structural failures.
- üåç Environmental impact reduction: Minimized resource consumption through efficient maintenance.

**Tools & Techniques:**

SHM relies on sensors (strain gauges, accelerometers, etc.) to collect data. This data is processed using signal conditioning, ADCs (Analog - Digital Converter), and data loggers. Advanced analytics involve statistical methods, machine learning, and signal processing techniques. Software like MATLAB, Python, and specialized platforms aid in data management, modeling, and visualization. Tools like Grafana and Prometheus provide interactive dashboards for monitoring and time-series data management.

### Conversational Image Recognition Chatbot
**10/2024 - Present | Personal Project**

This project combines natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition to create a chatbot capable of identifying objects within images and responding to user queries. By integrating computer vision with conversational AI, this chatbot allows users to interact with images in a more intuitive way.

**Key Features:**

- üì∑ **Image Recognition**: The chatbot uses image recognition models to analyze and detect objects within images.
- üí¨ **Conversational AI**: It incorporates NLP to understand user queries and respond with relevant information about detected objects.
- üåê **Web Integration**: The chatbot can be integrated into websites, providing an interactive and dynamic way to engage users through both image recognition and text-based conversation.

**Technologies Involved:**

- **Hugging Face**: Utilized for NLP models.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image processing.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning framework used for building image recognition models.
- **React**: Front-end integration for user interaction.

This project aims to bring the power of AI to a more user-friendly, interactive experience, blending visual input with smart conversation.
